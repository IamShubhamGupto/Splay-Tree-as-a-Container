# Splay-Tree as a Container

This project recreates the Map class of the Standard Template Library in C++ using the self-balancing tree data structure Splay Trees. The current version of the container is generic and should work with most datatypes. Apart from implementing a very familiar interface of that of std::map, we also compare the performance of SplayTree to std::map. Most functionality has been added to the container however there is room for improvements and additional functions. 

## How to Compile & Test

  <summary><b> Linux & Mac </b> </summary>
  
  ### Compilation  
  
  ```shell
  git clone https://github.com/IamShubhamGupto/Splay-Tree-as-a-Container.git
  cd Splay-Tree-as-a-Container
  make clientfile=<ENTER PATH TO CLIENT FILE NAME HERE>
  ./bin/a.out
  ```  

  <b>EXAMPLE </b>
  
  ```shell
  make clientfile=examples/client1.cpp
  ./bin/a.out
  ```
  
  ### Testing  
  
  Prerequiste:
  
  ```shell
  pip3 install matplotlib
  ```
  
  Guide:
  
  ```
Usage: python3 tests/run_test.py [options] {-t | --testtype}

Required for execution:
        -t, --testtype <test types>
                Select type of test to run

        <test types>:

                1 - run insertion, delete and updation test at different number of operations

                2 - run insertion test at at different number of operations

                3 - run deletion test at different number of operations

                4 - run updation test at different number of operations

options:
        -m, --max_ops <maximum operations>
                Maximum number of operations - insertions/updates/deletions to performed.
                Default=1000

        -k, --max_keys <maximum keys>
                Maximum number of unique keys stored in container.
                Default = 100

        -h, --help
                Display Help
  ```
  
  <b>EXAMPLE </b>
  
  ```shell
  python3 tests/run_test.py -t tests/test1.cpp -m 10000 -k 100
  ```
  #### Clean Up
